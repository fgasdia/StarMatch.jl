An implementation of Approach 3 (_Rotation Invariant Vector Frame_) from:
``A reliable and fast lost-in-space mode star tracker'' by Metha Deval Samirbhai.

# TODO

- More efficient/lighter weight storage (don't actually store types, just use indices?)
- Proper motion
- Usage interface
- Documentation
